Welcome to the ngl documentation.

ngl is a language using uncommon concepts, to understand them, please read the [introduction]

# Objectives

- **generic** : compile to anything
- **minimize code duplication** (using the cluster system and the ngl vcs)
- **powerful metaprogrammation** : abstraction of the program phase (compilation, build time, runtime, jit etc ...)
- **highly customizable** : ngl syntax can be rewritten in ngl, common programming concepts can be written in ngl
- **use the same system for everything** : compilation, build system, vcs use ngl
- **collaborative** : improve generic code using a common code base
- **inclusive** : use the ngl shape concept to allow external syntaxes

# Use cases

- write a complete program
- use for scripting
- generate code for other languages
- write common algorithm once for any languages
- store data in a format with easy conversion to other formats
- create DSL easily using the ngl shapes
